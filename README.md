## Installation

#### Package Control
The best way is to install it via [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/). Once you have Package Control setup in Sublime Text, open the command palette and search for `Package Control: Install Package`. Search for `BetterJinja` and install it. Package Control will take care for of automatically updating the package for you if there are new releases.

You can also use `Package Control: Add Repository`. Copy the github url (without the `.git` at the end) and enter it into the input panel that pops up at the bottom when you select `Package Control: Add Repository`. Now use `Package Control: Install Package` and search for `BetterJinja` and install it.

## Documentation

### Key bindings

- The key bindings are configured so that pressing <kbd>shift + {</kbd> **twice** will automatically add spaces on both sides for the inner brace expression block & place the cursor in the center, like so `{{ | }}`.
- |||ly pressing <kbd>shift + %</kbd> within `{}` will add spaces on both sides of the inner `%` like so `{% | %}`
- You can use <kbd>ctrl + /</kbd> for inserting Jinja2 style line comments (`## This is a line comment`)
- Similarly, use <kbd>ctrl + shift + /</kbd> for block style comments (`{# This is a block comment #}`)

### Auto completions
In order to get the auto completions, go to `Preferences: Settings` from the command palette and paste the following in the `Preferences.sublime-settings -- User` (the right hand window)

```json
"auto_complete_selector": "text.jinja, meta.tag - punctuation.definition.tag.begin, source - comment - string.quoted.double.block - string.quoted.single.block - string.unquoted.heredoc",
"auto_complete_triggers":
[
    {"characters": "<", "selector": "text.html"},
    {"selector": "text.jinja, text.html.basic"},
]
```

If you already have these in your user settings, then just copy the Twig related portions into them.
